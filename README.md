# My Dotfiles (WIP)

This repository is for my configs.  I mainly update my .emacs.d as it is my primary editor so be prepared for most commits to come from that.
Many of the other configs are either hacked together from cursory readings of manuals/guides or fully taken from a kickstart repo (eg my neovim config). 
I don't think anything is in a clean enough state to be used for inspiration or another machine.  


## TODO 
+ I'm working on porting my systems to nix, but that's a fairly lengthy project and don't expect to be finished anytime soon.
+ I want to put my more active git repos in submodules so that commit history stays separate (really just emacs lol)
